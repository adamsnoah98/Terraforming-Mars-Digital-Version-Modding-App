# Terraforming Mars Digital Version Modding App
A flutter app to schedule and programmatically mod specific cards into the digital version of Terraforming Mars.

Currently this working prototype is a basic MVP, additional bugs probably exist, and I have plans for multiple additional features. Check assets/static-text/info/upcoming.txt for a list.

The app is currently only implemented for Android and tested on limited devices, though most of the code is platform agnostic.
